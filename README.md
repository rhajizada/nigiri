# Nigiri

Personal Arch Linux setup with GNOME. This project automates the installation of
packages, GNOME extensions, and system services, applying my favorite themes and
configs for a clean, customized look.

## Setup

1. Install and login into Arch Linux.
2. Clone and setup [dotfiles](https://github.com/rhajizada/dotfiles).
3. Run `./install.sh --noconfirm`
4. Once services are restarted and user has logged into desktop run
`./install.sh` again.
